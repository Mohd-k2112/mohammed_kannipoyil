                At <strong>100SMILES Dental Care</strong>, we believe dental care should be
                affordable and accessible for everyone. That’s why we provide
                <strong>seasonal discounts, community events, and special offers “specially for children”</strong>
                and patients of all ages.
            </p>

            <p class="size">
                Our latest offers include a <strong>FREE dental check-up event</strong>, online booking
                discounts, and a limited-time offer on our Annual Dental Check-Up package — helping you
                stay on top of your oral health without worrying about high costs.
            </p>

            <p class="size">
                The free check-up event includes a full examination, personalised dental advice,
                and an advance booking cleanup at no cost. Spaces are limited, so early booking
                is recommended.
