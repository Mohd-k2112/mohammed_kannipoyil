  <h1>CP5638 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
  <p><strong>Name:</strong> MOHAMMED KANNIPOYIL</p>

  <h2>Goal</h2>
  <p>
    The goal of the 100Smiles Dental Care website is to strengthen the clinic’s online presence by helping more
    patients easily access clear, organised, and age-friendly information about the services they offer. The mission
    of the website is to <strong>increase patient engagement and enquiries</strong> by making essential details—such as
    services, staff, trading hours, announcements, and contact options—simple to find and understand.
    <br><br>
    This website aims to achieve measurable improvements by increasing the number of online enquiries, encouraging
    interaction with promotional offers, and guiding patients toward preventive care such as regular check-ups and
    cleanings.
  </p>

  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
  <p>
    The success of the 100Smiles Dental Care website will be evaluated by measuring how effectively it
    achieves its mission of improving patient engagement and increasing access to clear, organised dental
    information. The following measurable indicators will be used:
    <br><br>
    • <strong>Number of enquiries made using the contact information</strong> provided on the website, showing whether
    the site encourages patients to reach out for appointments or dental support.<br>
    • <strong>Engagement with announcements</strong> such as discounts and special offers included in the client’s
    content,
    measured by increased enquiries related to these offers.<br>
    • <strong>User interaction with educational articles</strong> provided by the clinic, showing whether patients are
    using the
    website for learning and preventive care information.<br>
    • <strong>Ease of locating essential information</strong> such as trading hours, services, staff details, and clinic
    location,
    evaluated by user feedback or reduced confusion during enquiries.<br><br>
    These quantifiable measures will show whether the website is successfully improving communication,
    supporting patient understanding, and helping 100Smiles Dental Care expand its online reach.
  </p>

  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>
  Although 100Smiles Dental Care provides services for patients of all ages, the specific target audience for 
  this website is <strong>children who are attending dental visits for the first time or who require ongoing 
  preventive care</strong>. This includes young children whose parents are seeking a welcoming and supportive 
  dental environment that helps reduce dental anxiety and encourages healthy lifelong dental habits.
  <br><br>
  The website is intentionally designed to suit this child-focused audience by using:
  <br>
  • <strong>Simple, friendly language</strong> so children and parents can easily understand the information.<br>
  • <strong>Clear headings and well-organised sections</strong> to help parents quickly find services suitable for children.<br>
  • <strong>Reassuring staff introductions with photos</strong> to help children feel more comfortable before visiting the clinic.<br>
  • <strong>Highlighting preventive services</strong> such as check-ups, cleanings, and oral hygiene education aimed at children.<br>
  • <strong>A calm, clean layout</strong> that avoids clutter, making the website easier for parents to browse and understand.<br><br>
  These design choices ensure that the site specifically supports children and their parents, even though the 
  clinic provides care for all ages.
